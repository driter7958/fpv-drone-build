# FPV quad drone build
FPV drone build 

My quad flying journey...    I started with a whoop drone....  Adding a 5" toothpick racing quad to my fleet.  

My tiny whoop...   [Cetus X FPV Kit](https://betafpv.com/products/cetus-x-fpv-kit?variant=39948655394950)    was lost ton the winds.  
Should I replace it???    how to tune it out to make it less sensitive to fly indoors?
