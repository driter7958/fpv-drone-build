# FPV drove build
FPV drone build 

My quad flying journey...    I started with the training drone....    [Cetus X FPV Kit](https://betafpv.com/products/cetus-x-fpv-kit?variant=39948655394950)

Connecting with Buckeye FPV group...    discord?  

To see my flight, checkout my [Phoenix Pilot](https://www.youtube.com/@PhoenixPilot7958) you tube channel.   

I am imaging building a larger 5" or 7" toothpick drone for more outdoor activities.
